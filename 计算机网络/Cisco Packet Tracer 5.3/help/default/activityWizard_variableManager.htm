<p> In the <strong>Variable Manager </strong>panel , you will be able to add dynamism to activities.

To enable the <strong>Variable Manager</strong>, select either <strong>Intermediate</strong> or <strong>Advanced</strong> for the <strong>Activity Creation Experience</strong> setting in the Welcome panel and then click on the <strong>Show Variable Manager Interface </strong>checkbox in the Variable Manager panel.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Creating Pools</p>
<p>In the <strong>Pools</strong> tab, you can create a pool of numbers, strings, and IP addresses. For the <strong>Number</strong> pool, you can create a pool of numbers ranging from Min to Max. For the <strong>Strings</strong> pool, you can create a pool of strings separated by a semicolon ";" as shown in the screenshot above. The <strong>Strings</strong> pool can be a list of IP addresses, strings, or even numbers where the pool is non-continuous. For the <strong>IP Address</strong> pool, you can create a pool of IP addresses with the network address, mask address, and the range of IP addresses. To remove a pool,  select the appropriate pool and hit Delete on the keyboard.</p>
